# AircraftMesher
This Glyph script demonstrates how to automate the viscous meshing process for an aircraft geometry. Using a generic transport geometry created with OpenVSP, the user can define the farfield size, boundary layer resolution, and quality controls for the grid. The CAE boundary conditions are set up automatically and the final grid saved to the current working directory.
